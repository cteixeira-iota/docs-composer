= Invoke a Composer Flow 

Invoke a Composer flow from external systems directly from Flow Builder to enable deeper interoperability and integrated capabilities across Salesforce. You can also authenticate every invocable flow for a secure and protected automation experience, create API-compatible invocable actions for seamless integration with diverse systems and applications, and build powerful automations by leveraging the built-in support for input fields.

== Invoke a Composer Flow in Flow Builder

Invoke a Composer flow directly from Flow Builder to build integrations without writing a single line of code.

For example, use invocable flows to build integrations in Flow Builder that connect to third-party systems such as NetSuite, Jira, and Workday. Some use cases include using Flow Builder to call an invocable Composer flow that:

* Creates a Jira issue when a record is created in Salesforce.
* Retrieves an order status from NetSuite and posts a message in Slack.
* Gets real-time credit scores when a user goes through a screen flow.

To invoke a Composer flow in Flow Builder, you must:

. <<configure-your-invocable-composer-flow,Configure your invocable Composer flow>>.
. <<test-your-invocable-composer-flow,Test your invokable Composer flow>>.
. <<activate-your-invocable-composer-flow,Activate your invocable Composer flow>>.
. <<set-up-salesforce-for-invocable-flows,Set up Salesforce for invocable flows>>.
. <<set-up-flow-builder-for-invocable-flows,Set up Flow Builder for invocable flows>>.

=== Configure your Invocable Composer Flow

To configure an invocable Composer flow:

. Access Composer.
. xref:ms_composer_flows.adoc#reate-a-new-flow[Create a new flow from scratch].
. In the *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog, in the *Interaction* section, click *Invoke* to create an invocable flow. + 
The *Trigger: Invoke this flow from an external system via HTTP POST Request* trigger appears. 
. Optionally, add input fields. For example, you can add an `Opportunity ID` input that returns a value if Salesforce passes the value of an Opportunity ID to the Composer flow. To add input fields, click *Add Input Fields*. You can define input fields using the *Visual Editor* or the *Sample JSON Editor*. 

.. To define input fields using the *Visual Editor*:
... In the *Input Name* field, enter a unique name for the input field.
... In the *Data Type* dropdown, select the data type you want to use for the input field. The following xref:ms_composer_custom_expression_editor.adoc#data-types[data types] are supported: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `DateTime`.
... Optionally, add a *Sample Value* or *Help Text* to test the flow. 
... To add more input fields, click *Add Input*.
... Click *Apply*. +
The number of input fields you added appears next to *Input Fields*, displaying one or more new input fields added to the flow.
... Optionally, to change the input fields, click *Add Input Fields* to open the *Visual Editor* to edit the input fields.

.. To define input fields using the Sample *JSON Editor*:
... In the *Example Request* window, paste or enter the JSON sample. 

+
.Example: JSON sample in the *Sample JSON Editor* window
[%collapsible]
====
[source,JSON]
----
{
{    
"name": "ben",
"age": 100
}
}

Unlike the Visual Editor, the Sample JSON Editor supports objects, arrays, and 
null values. 

+
.Example: Example: Complex JSON sample in the *Sample JSON Editor* window
[%collapsible]
====
[source,JSON]
----
{
"data": {
"favoriteNumbers": [3, 7, 13, 17, 23]
}
}

... Click *Apply*. +
The number of input fields you added appears next to *Input Fields*, displaying one or more new input fields added to the flow.
... Optionally, to change the input fields, click *Add Input Fields* to open the *Sample JSON Editor* to edit the input fields.

. Complete the flow. For example, configure system actions for the flow, define variables, or create flow controls. For more information, see xref:ms_composer_flows.adoc[Build a Composer Flow]. 
. Click *Save* to save your flow.

=== Delete an Invocable Flow Step

If you need to delete an invocable step in your flow: 

. Access the flow containing the invocable flow step that you want to delete. 
. In the left corner of the step, click â€¦ > *Delete step*. +
The step is deleted.
 
[[test-your-invocable-composer-flow]]
=== Test Your Invocable Composer Flow 

To test your invocable Composer flow: 

. In your invocable flow, click *Test*.
. If you have added input fields, the *Test Flow* window appears.
. Enter a sample value for the input field or review the complex JSON to test the flow.
. Click *Test Flow*. +
The testing output appears. Using this output, you can verify if the flow returns the expected values in the sample output of the main canvas.

== Troubleshooting 

When Flow Builder successfully invokes a Composer flow, an HTTP 200 response occurs. To troubleshoot invocable flows, become familiar with the information about interpreting commonly thrown exception messages.

== Missing Required Input Parameters
If a Composer flow requires input fields and Flow Builder does not pass these required input fields, an HTTP 400 response occurs.

== Invalid Credentials 
If a Composer flow has invalid credentials, an HTTP 401 response occurs.
