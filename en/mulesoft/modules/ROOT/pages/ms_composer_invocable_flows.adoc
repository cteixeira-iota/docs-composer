= Invoke a Composer Flow 

Invoke a Composer flow from external systems to enable deeper interoperability and integrated capabilities across Salesforce. You can also authenticate every invocable flow for a secure and protected automation experience, create API-compatible invocable actions for seamless integration with diverse systems and applications, and build powerful automations by leveraging the built-in support for input fields.

When your invocable flow is activated, Composer exposes a unique flow URL and a unique pair of client credentials (client ID and client secret) so that your flow can be invoked from external systems. You can reset these credentials for security best practices. Invoke invocable flows by using an HTTP call to the flow URL and using the flow client credentials as authentication. 

To invoke a Composer flow:

. <<create-an-invocable-composer-flow, Create an invocable Composer flow.>> 
. <<invoke-the-composer-flow-from-an-external-system, Invoke the Composer flow from an external system.>>

* *Request Method*: `POST`
* *Request Path*: `/`
* *Request Headers*
** *Key*: `Content-Type`
** *Value*: `application/json`
* *Request Body*: Input fields of the invocable flow

. Click *Connect*. After the connection is created, a flow can invoke another invocable flow. 

=== Invoke a Composer Flow from Flow Builder

Invoke a Composer flow directly from Flow Builder to build integrations without writing a single line of code.

For example, use invocable flows to build integrations in Flow Builder that connect to third-party systems such as NetSuite, Jira, and Workday. Some use cases include using Flow Builder to call an invocable Composer flow that:

* Creates a Jira issue when a record is created in Salesforce.
* Retrieves an order status from NetSuite and posts a message in Slack.
* Gets real-time credit scores when a user goes through a screen flow.
* Retrieves an order status from NetSuite when a user enters an order ID in the screen flow.

To invoke a Composer flow from Flow Builder, you must:

. <<set-up-salesforce-for-invocable-flows,Set up Salesforce for invocable flows>>.
. <<set-up-flow-builder-for-invocable-flows,Set up Flow Builder for invocable flows>>.

[[set-up-salesforce-for-invocable-flows]]
==== Set Up Salesforce for Invocable Flows

After creating your Composer flow, set up your Salesforce org to invoke flows in Composer: 

. Access your Salesforce org. 
. Go to *Setup* > *MuleSoft* > *Services* and click *Log In* to securely connect Anypoint Platform with your Salesforce org and grant access.
. Create a new set of credentials that use the same credentials that you use for Composer. Create an external credential and a named credential. If your invocable Composer flow does not contain input fields, you must add a new `Content-Length` custom header that has a value of `0` in the external credential and named credential to avoid an HTTP 411 response. 
+
To create an external credential and a named credential, you must:

.. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.nc_create_edit_custom_auth_ext_cred.htm&type=5[Create and Edit a Custom Authentication External Credential].
.. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.nc_enable_ext_cred_principal.htm&type=5[Enable External Credential Principals].
.. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.nc_custom_headers_basic_auth.htm&type=5[Use Basic Authentication with Named Credentials].  
.. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.nc_create_edit_named_credential.htm&type=5[Create and Edit a Named Credential]. 

. Register your external service by copying the API specification from the Composer flow. For more information, refer to https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.external_services_register_json.htm&type=5[Paste the JSON-formatted Schema Into Your Browser]. 

[[set-up-flow-builder-for-invocable-flows]]
==== Set Up Flow Builder for Invocable Flows 

After setting up Salesforce for invocable flows, you can call the Composer flow from Flow Builder:

. Access your Salesforce org.
. Go to *Setup* > *Process Automation* > *Flows*.
. Click *New Flow* to create a new flow in Flow Builder. 
. Select the type of flow you want to create, for example, a *Record-Triggered Flow*, and then click *Create*.

. Set up an invocable action. Click *+* to add a new element and then click *Action*.
. In *Filter By*, select *Type* and click *External Service*. 
. Select the action of the invocable flow from the external service.
. Enter a *Label* and *API Name*. 
. If you are invoking a Composer flow with inputs, follow these steps: 
+
In *Set Input Values*, for *body*, set the input value to the external service that triggers the Composer flow. +
+
To set the input value, click *New Resource* and ensure the following fields have values:

* *Resource Type*: Select a resource type.
* *API Name*: Enter a name for the API.
* *Data Type*: Select a data type.
* *Apex Class*: Search for an Apex class.
* *Availability Outside the Flow*: Select *Available for input* and *Available for output* if needed. 

+
For example, if Salesforce passes the value of an opportunity ID to the Composer flow, 
the values are: 

* *Resource Type*: `Variable`
* *API Name*: `InvocableFlowInputPayload`
* *Data Type*: `Apex-Defined`
* *Apex Class*: `ExternalService__InvocableFlowTest_invoke_IN_body`
* *Availability Outside the Flow*: *Available for input* and *Available for output*

. Click *Done*. +
The invocable action is set up. 
. Click *Done*. 
. Add an assignment. Click *+* above the action to add a new element and then click *Assignment*.
. Enter a *Label* and *API Name*. 
. Set variable values:
* *Variable*: Enter the *API Name* of the new resource from step 10.
* *Operator*: Select the operator to indicate or change the value. 
* *Value*: The value is assigned to the input fields when creating the invocable flow.

+
For example, to set a value from a Salesforce record to an opportunity ID variable, the values are: 
* *Variable*: `{!InvocableFlowInputPayload.opportunityId}`
* *Operator*: `equals` 
* *Value*: `{!$Record.id}`

. Save the flow. Enter a *Flow Label* and *Flow API Name*. 
. Click *Save*.
. Debug the flow. For more information, refer to https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_test_debug.htm&type=5[Debug a Flow in Flow Builder].

. Activate the flow. For more information, refer to https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_distribute_activate.htm&type=5[Activate or Deactivate a Flow].  

== Troubleshooting 

When an external system successfully invokes a Composer flow, an HTTP 200 response occurs. To troubleshoot invocable flows, become familiar with the information about interpreting commonly thrown exception messages.

=== Missing Required Input Parameters

If a Composer flow requires input fields and the external system does not pass these required input fields, an HTTP 400 response occurs.

=== Invalid Credentials 

If a Composer flow has invalid credentials, an HTTP 401 response occurs.
