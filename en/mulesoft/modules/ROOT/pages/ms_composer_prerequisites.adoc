ifeval::["{product}"=="salesforce"]
== Requirements and Restrictions

* The org where you set up Composer must be a Salesforce Unlimited, Enterprise, or Performance edition. It can't be a sandbox org.
* The maximum number of concurrent users supported by an organization is 25.
* The org must have Lightning enabled.
* You must purchase a separate MuleSoft Composer license for the org.
* If your company network has a stringent firewall or list of blocked IP addresses, your network administrator must add `*.mulesoft.com` to the list of allowed addresses.
+
IP addresses used by Composer are dynamic, therefore MuleSoft can't provide a list of IP addresses.
* You must relax any IP restrictions for the connections that you create to data sources and data targets. Instructions are included in the setup section of this topic.
* Composer does not currently support mobile platforms.

=== Browser Requirements:

* Don't use incognito mode or private browsers to access Composer.
* Composer uses Salesforce Canvas and therefore has the same browser requirements as Canvas. For Safari browsers, this means you must uncheck the *Prevent cross-site tracking* option in Safari security preferences.
* When using Firefox or Chrome, you must allow third-party cookies.
* When you create a connection to another system, check for the requirements and limitations listed in the Composer reference section for each connection.
* Composer fields with date values use the following format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ.

== Set Up Composer

Before anyone can use Composer, a Salesforce admin must set it up, including installation, permissions assignments, and a few adjustments to your Salesforce org settings.

=== Find the Composer Setup Page

. Log in to your Salesforce org as an admin.
. Click the Setup gear icon, and then choose *Setup*.
. Enter `composer` in the search bar.
. Select *MuleSoft Composer* from the search results.
+
If you can't find Composer in the search results, it's likely that your org needs to purchase a license for Composer.

Next, you'll install Composer and make some Salesforce org adjustments to ensure Composer works properly.

=== Admin: Adjust the Session Settings

. In the Salesforce Composer sidebar, click *Settings*, *Security*, and then click *Session Settings*.
. On the *Sessions Settings* page, in the *Session Settings* subsection, deselect the *Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated* checkbox.
. Click *Save*.

=== Admin: Install Composer and Adjust Salesforce Org Settings

. In the *Install the Managed Package for MuleSoft Composer* section, click *Install Managed Package*.
+
Four more steps are revealed when the installation is complete. As the admin performing the installation, you are automatically given the Composer permission set.

. In the *Change the Type of Permitted Users* section, click *Open Settings* to launch the Salesforce connected app page for Composer and change two settings:
     .. In the *Permitted Users* dropdown, select *Admin approved users are pre-authorized*.
     .. In the *IP Relaxation* dropdown, select *Relax IP restrictions*.
     .. Save the changes.

. In the *Configure MuleSoft Services* section, click *Initiate Configuration*.
+
Salesforce certificates expire after one year. To renew an expired certificate, click *Initiate Configuration*.
+
MuleSoft creates and configures an instance of Anypoint Platform to provide a dedicated environment for Composer.
. In the *Assign Users to MuleSoft Composer* section, click the *Assign Users* button to go directly to the Salesforce *Permission Sets* page:
     .. Click *Composer User*.
     .. Click *Manage Assignments*, and then *Add Assignments*.
     .. Select the checkbox next to each user who will receive permission to use Composer.
     .. Click *Add*. You can assign or revoke this permission set at any time.
. In the *Launch MuleSoft Composer* section, click the *Launch* button to start Composer.

Now that Composer is configured properly, you can launch it by searching for "composer" in the App Launcher.

You can sync data between two Salesforce organizations with a single license. When you set up Composer, you can choose the primary organization in which you want to build flows and then, within Composer in that organization, you can create connections to one or more other Salesforce organizations.

== Users: Verify Access to Composer

If you aren't the Salesforce admin who installed Composer, verify that you have access to the Composer app:

. In your Salesforce org, open the App Launcher.
. Enter `composer` in the search bar.
. Select *MuleSoft Composer* from the search results.
+
If you don't see *MuleSoft Composer* in the search results,
it's likely that you need to purchase Composer for your Salesforce org or that you don't have permission to access it.

When the Composer page displays, you're ready to create your first flow. If you'd like to learn more before using Composer, review the other topics in this section.
