| Previously, in the Google Sheets Connector when Google Sheets was the trigger, all output fields were returned as `text` regardless of the assigned data type (for example, `int` or` `bool`). As a result, if you attempted to map the trigger data pills to non-text fields in the action, you encountered an error. Now, trigger fields retain their original data types and you can map them appropriately in subsequent actions. | SE-227701, COCN-575
