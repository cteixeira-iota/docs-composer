[[change-a-connection]]
== Change a Connection

You can change connections in a trigger or action for all steps (at the flow level) or for individual steps. For example, you can create a flow using connections to a Salesforce sandbox org, and then after your flow testing is complete, you can change the connection in your trigger and actions to use a production org.

You can only change to a connection accessing the same system type. You can't change a Workday connection to a Google Sheets connection, for example.

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that connects to a sandbox:

[[delete-a-connection]]
== Delete a Connection

If you no longer need a specific connection, you can delete it.

To delete a connection:

. If you create a new flow:
 .. Select the connector or system to start your flow.

 .. In the *Next Step* window, click the gear icon.
. In the *Manage <Connector Name> Connections* window, next to the connection that you want to delete, click the trashcan. +
A message appears ensuring that you want to delete the selected connection. A window appears, displaying a list of flows currently using that connection. If the connection is: +
* Not used in any flows, you can delete the connection.
* Used in inactive flows, a list containing the name and count of inactive flows using this connection appears. Deleting this connection will affect the listed flows. If you reopen the inactive flow, you must <<change-a-connection,select a new connection>>.
* Used in active and inactive flows, a list containing the name, count, and status of active and inactive flows using this connection appears. If you choose to delete the connection, secondary confirmation appears. Prior to deleting the connection, Composer will first attempt to stop the flows.
