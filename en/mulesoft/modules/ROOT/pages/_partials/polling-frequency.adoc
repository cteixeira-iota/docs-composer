For this connector, the *Polling Frequency* field is required for triggers. This field enables you to select how often Composer makes a request to the underling system API to look for changes to records. You can select a different polling frequency for each flow in your organization. With a shorter frequency, the flow executes more often; however, a shorter frequency consumes more xref:ms_composer_automation_credits.adoc[API calls]. For example, if you have an order management flow, you require nearly real-time updates, which can be achieved with a 15 second polling interval. In contrast, if your flow updates a pricing catalog, you could poll the flow every few hours.
