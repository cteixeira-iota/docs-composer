= Using a Flow and Creating a Trigger

You can use Composer to address integration problems in your organization by building and configuring flows. In Composer, a _trigger_ is the flowâ€™s sequence of actions. This is the first step of a flow. Prior to creating a trigger, you must first create, clone, or import a flow. 

== Create a Flow

You can create a new flow (from scratch or from template) or clone an existing flow.

=== Create a New Flow From Scratch

To create a new flow from scratch:

ifeval::["{product}"=="salesforce"]
. From the Composer *Home* page, click *Create New Flow > Create Flow from Scratch*. +
Your flow is named automatically.
. Optionally, click the pencil icon next to *_flow name_* to rename the flow. Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, hyphen ( - ), dot ( . ), and underscore ( _ ).
. Click *Save*.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{product}"=="mulesoft"]
. From the Composer *Home* page, click *Create new flow > Create Flow from Scratch*. +
Your flow is named automatically.
. To change the name automatically created for your new flow, click the pencil icon next to *Untitled Flow* and create a custom name using any of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, hyphen ( - ), dot ( . ), and underscore ( _ ).
. Click *Save*.
endif::[]

Now you are ready to create a flow trigger.

[[create-a-new-flow-from-template]]
=== Create a New Flow From Template

To create a new flow from template:

. From the Composer *Home* page, click *Create new Flow > Create Flow from Template*.
. Explore the template options and select the template you want to use.
. Ensure you meet the prerequisites and if so, click *Use this Template*.
. Configure your connections and information required by the flow.
. Click *Create flow*.

Now you are ready to use your flow. For more information about templates, refer to xref:ms_composer_build_a_flow_using_templates.adoc[Build a Flow Using Templates].

=== Clone an Existing Flow

To clone an existing flow:

ifeval::["{product}"=="salesforce"]
. From the *Composer Flows* tab, click the name of the flow you want to clone. Composer displays the *Flow Details* page.
. Click *Clone*.
. Composer copies the existing flow and opens the copy in the Flow Details page. Notice the flow is named *Copy of _original flow name_*.
. Optionally, click the pencil icon next to *Copy of _original flow name_* to rename the flow. Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, hyphen ( - ), dot ( . ), and underscore ( _ ).
. Click *Save*.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{product}"=="mulesoft"]
. From the sidebar, click *Flows*.
. On the *Flows* page, click the name of the flow you want to clone.
. Click *Clone*.
+
Composer copies the existing flow and opens the copy in the Flow Details page. Notice that the flow is named *Copy of _original flow name_*.
. If you want to rename the flow, click the pencil icon next to *Copy of _original flow name_* and use any of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, hyphen ( - ), dot ( . ), and underscore ( _ ).
. Click *Save*.

. Click *Import Flow*. Note that importing a flow will replace the existing flow. +
The flow is imported and appears on the *<Flow Name>* page. 
. Click *Save*. +
The flow is imported. 
endif::[]

ifeval::["{product}"=="mulesoft"]

== Refresh a Flow

When building a flow, you may need to refresh the flow to view updated data at either the object level or the field level.

To refresh a object:

. Open the flow.
. Click the refresh icon in the upper right corner of the trigger or action card that you want to refresh.
+
image:images/composer_refresh_card.png[Refreshing an object]
The cache for the object type is cleared and the new data is retrieved.

To refresh a field:

. Open the flow.
. Click the refresh icon in the bottom left corner of the trigger or action card.
+
image:images/composer_refresh_field.png[Refreshing a field]
The cache for the field is cleared. The new value providers for the field are retrieved.

== Create a Flow Trigger

After you create or clone a flow, define the trigger: the event or time interval that starts the flow. A trigger step is required to test or activate your flow.

To define a trigger based on an event:

. Open a flow if it is not already open. The *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog is displayed.
. Select the connector where the triggering event occurs. Your existing connections are displayed.
+
You can choose an existing connection or create a new one:

* Click an existing connection to select it.
* Click *Add new _connector name_ Connection* to create a new connection and select it. +
You can rename or delete connections from this dialog by clicking the gear icon.

. After you choose a connection, the trigger step displays:
+
image:images/trigger-definition.png[Trigger step, 600]
+
Your trigger is named automatically. All triggers are named by combining the event or operation with the system name. For example, "On new record in Salesforce".

* Optionally, you can rename the trigger. Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, hyphen ( - ), dot ( . ), and underscore ( _ ).

* Choose an event that starts the flow. Supply additional information as requested.

* Click *Save*.
