= Build Formulas for a Flow

You can manipulate data in Composer by building expressions and applying functions. With the *Custom Expression Editor*, you can create expressions that include functions and mathematical operators. For example, you can truncate words, capitalize phrases, and set the date.

//More content may be added - to be determined later
* Functions can be nested. The input parameters of a function can be another function call.
* The functions used in Composer are built using https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.3/dw-operators[DataWeave].

|capitalize |Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string. This also removes underscores between words and puts a space before each capitalized word.

If the number is equal to or greater than the number of characters in the string, the function returns the entire string. |first(Hello Composer!, 5) = Hello |text: String +

numCharacters: Number |String

|last |Returns the specified number of characters from the end of a string.  For example, the last nine characters of a string. |last(Hello Composer!, 9) = Composer! |text: String +

numCharacters: Number|String

|substitute |Replaces all substrings that match a literal search string with a specified replacement string. Replacement proceeds from the beginning of the string to the end. For example, the result of replacing "aa" with "b" in the string` "aaa" is "ba", rather than "ab". |substitute(Composer, o, O) = COmpOser +

substitute(Composer, a, Example) = Composer |text: String +
target: String +
replacement: String |
