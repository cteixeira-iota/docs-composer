= Build Formulas for a Flow

You can manipulate data in Composer by building expressions and applying functions. With the *Custom Expression Editor*, you can create expressions that include functions and mathematical operators. For example, you can truncate words, capitalize phrases, and set the date.

== Before You Begin

//More content may be added - to be determined later
* Functions can be nested. The input parameters of a function can be another function call.
* The functions used in Composer are built using https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.3/dw-operators[DataWeave].

== About the Custom Expression Editor

Using the *Custom Expression Editor*, you can manipulate your input data by building expressions and applying functions beyond basic one-to-one mapping.

=== String Functions

The *Custom Expression Editor* supports the following `string` formulas and operators:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===

|Function Name |Description |Example |Input Data Type Parameters |Output Data Type

|lower | Returns the provided string in lowercase characters. |`lower(COMPOSER) = composer` |text: String |String

|upper |Returns the provided string in uppercase characters. |`upper(composer) = COMPOSER` |text: String |String

|capitalize |Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string. This also removes underscores between words and puts a space before each capitalized word.
|`capitalize(name) = Name` +

`capitalize(firstName) = First Name` +

`capitalize(customer_first_name) = Customer First Name` +
|text: String |String

|trim |Removes any blank spaces from the beginning and end of a string.
|`trim(<long example text>) = this example long text` |text: String |String

|first |Returns the specified number of characters from the beginning of a string. For example, you can return the first five characters of a string. If the number is equal to or greater than the number of characters in the string, the function returns the entire string. |`first(Hello Composer!, 5) = Hello` |text: String +

numCharacters: Number |String

|last |Returns the specified number of characters from the end of a string.  For example, you can return the last nine characters of a string. |`last(Hello Composer!, 9) = Composer!` |text: String +

numCharacters: Number|String

|substitute |Replaces all substrings that match a literal search string with a specified replacement string. Replacement proceeds from the beginning of the string to the end. For example, the result of replacing `aa` with `b` in the string `aaa` is `ba`, rather than `ab`. |`substitute(Composer, o, O) = COmpOser` +

`substitute(Composer, a, Example) = Composer`

|text: String +

target: String +

replacement: String |String

|===

It is important to note that in a `string` field, you can `number` expressions selected from the operator list; however, they must be enclosed within a parenthesis. For example, you can enter `abc(9+9)` where the `+` is selected from the operator list. This string renders as `abc18`.

=== Number Functions

In the editor, there is a difference between a math operator (+,-,*, or /) selected from the operator list versus an operator typed and resolved as a string character. For example, typing `9+9` is actually a string rather than `18`. To use math operators, select them from the operator list or use xref:ms_composer_custom_expression_editor.adoc#keyboard-shortcuts[keyboard shortcuts].

The *Custom Expression Editor* supports the following `number` formulas and operators:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===

|Function Name |Description |Example |Input Data Type Parameters |Output Data Type

|round |Rounds a number up or down to the nearest whole number. |`round(1.2) = 1` +

`round(4.6) = 5` +

`round(3.5) = 4` |number: Number |Number

|ceil |Rounds a number up to the nearest whole number. |`ceil(1.2) = 2` +

`ceil(3) = 3` |number: Number |Number

|floor |Rounds a number down to the nearest whole number. |`floor(2.2) = 2` +

`floor(3) = 3` |number: Number |Number

|abs |Returns the absolute value of a number. |`abs(-3.4) = 3.4` +

`abs(2) = 2` |number: Number |Number

== Data Types

The value that a field can accept for a value is a data type. In Composer, the following data types are available:

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|===

|Data Type |Definition

|Array | Provides a collection of a fixed number of components of the same data type.

|Boolean | Evaluates to true or false. Possible values: `true`, `false`

|Date | Stores a year, month, and day as ``yyyy-MM-dd.

|DateTime | Stores a date and time within a time zone, where a time zone is the time relative to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). A time zone must include a + or a -. For example, `03:00:00` is a time, while +03:00 is a time zone. For example, 12:30 p.m. on June 1, 2019 in Macau: `2019-06-01T12:30:00+08:00`

// |Integer | Stores whole numbers that range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647. An integer has no decimal point.

|Number | Stores a float number, which can range from 1.40129846432481707e-45 to 3.40282346638528860e+38 and include a decimal point, or an integer.

|Object | Refers to a composite data type that can contain other data types as properties (`boolean`, `date`, `number`, etc.).

|String | Stores text, numbers (not `number` data types), or a combination of both. Examples: "94u0sfjlk*(f!`lkkjd", "18005555555", "Fred"
