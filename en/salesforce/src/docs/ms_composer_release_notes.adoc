= Release Notes for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce

Use MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce to build connected experiences faster. You don't need to wait for development resources to unlock data, integrate apps, and automate business processes that create real customer value.

New versions are automatically available once they are released; you don't need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

//* Fixed the issue in Workday Connector in which the the *Create Worker* action returned a value for *Applicant Reference ID* but not for *Employee Reference*.
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which creating custom fields on the *Contact* object with the type `document` did not return results. | COCN-752
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which nested fields containing the `list` type failed. | COCN-726
//* Composer now supports the static creation of lists. You can now dynamically complete fields that are enabled for lists even if those fields do not have an existing list to map to in the flow.
