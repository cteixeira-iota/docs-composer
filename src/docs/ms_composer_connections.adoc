= Add a Connection

Before you create a flow, know the source of data you want and the credentials you need to access that data.
With this information, you'll create a connection that can be used at any point in your flow.

Connections protect your login credentials while giving easy acccess to data sources:

* Only you can see the connections you create.
* The credentials are never exposed or accessible after you create the connection.
* You can't remove a connection until you've removed every reference from it from every flow.
* You can't change the name of a connection after it is used in a flow that is deployed.

== Create and Add a New Connection

To create your first connection:

. Open up a flow or start a new one.

. Click *Add new connection* and then add the username, password, and URL where you usually type in these credentials.

Some systems require additional information. Check the Reference topic for that connection if you aren't familiar with the items being requested.

== Add an Existing Connection

To select an existing connection, open or start a flow, and then choose *Add new connection*.

== Change a Connection Name

To change the name of an existing connection that isn't in a deployed flow, choose *Manage*.

== Change a Connection

You can change connections in any trigger or action. For example, you can create a flow using connections to a Salesforce sandbox org, and then after your flow testing is complete, you can change the connection in your trigger and actions to use a production org.

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that connects to a sandbox:
