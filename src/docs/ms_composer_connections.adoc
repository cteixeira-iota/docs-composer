= Add a Connection

Before you create a flow, know the source of data you want, and the credentials you need to access that data.

To create your first connection:

. Open up a flow or start a new one.+

. Click *Add new connection*, and add the username, password, and URL where you usually type in these credentials.+

    * For NetSuite (special instructions? ask Stephen James)
    * **Any other connectors that special instructions?**

To select an existing connection, open or start a flow, and then choose *Add new connection*.

To change the name of an existing connection or delete it, choose *Manage*.

== More About Defining Connections

* Only you can see the connections you create.
* The credentials are never exposed or accessible after you create the connection.
* You can't remove a connection until you've removed every reference from it from every flow.
* You can't change the name of a connection after it is used in a flow that is deployed.
