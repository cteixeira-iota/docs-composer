= Add a Connection

Before you create a flow, know the source of data you want, and the credentials you need to access that data.
With this information, you'll create a connection that can be used at any point in your flow.

Connections protect your login credentials while giving easy acccess to data sources:

* Only you can see the connections you create.
* The credentials are never exposed or accessible after you create the connection.
* You can't remove a connection until you've removed every reference from it from every flow.
* You can't change the name of a connection after it is used in a flow that is deployed.

== Create and Add a New Connection

For Tableau, additional information is required:

        ** The Tableau URL, for example: \https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com

        ** The External testing token, which you can retrieve from the Tableau admin profile

        ** A random string which is generated **(where? how?)**

        ** The subfolder name **(where do they find this or is it always mulesoftconnectivity?)**
+
**Any other connectors that need special instructions?**

== Add an Existing Connection

To select an existing connection, open or start a flow, and then choose *Add new connection*.

== Change a Connection Name

To change the name of an existing connection that isn't in a deployed flow, choose *Manage*.
