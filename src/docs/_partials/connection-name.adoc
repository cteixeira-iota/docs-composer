Connection Name::

Enter a connection name that will help you remember the details of this connection.
You can reuse connections multiple times in a single flow, and in more than one flow,
and the credentials are hidden after you create the connection. Therefore, it's helpful
to provide a name that easily identifies it among all your connections in Composer.

Only you can see the connection. Other users in your Composer app must create their own connections.

If you are logged into the system from the same computer where you are operating Composer,
the authorization dialog may pop up without you having to fill in all of the following fields.
If you wish to log into the system as a different user, close the connection dialog in Composer, log out of the other system and then restart the connection dialog in Composer.
