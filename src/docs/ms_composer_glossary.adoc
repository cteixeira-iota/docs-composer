connection::

The credentials that give you access to a system where you want to access data: the username, password,
and URL where you send these credentials to gain access. A connection is specified for every step in a flow.

flow::

All of the steps (actions?) needed to complete an automated process on data, including the conditional logic, connections, and actions taken.

* trigger: The event or time that, when it occurs, tells the flow to start doing its work.
* action: something you do with or to data. Most processes require a number of actions.
* conditional logic: the circumstances or requirements that must be met before an action is taken.

**As far as the user is concerned, what is a step? A single action/connection combo? Do we need the concept of step?**
