= Build Composer Flows

Flows define the automated processes between two or more systems.

For example, you can automate any of these actions with Composer:

* Copy all new records in one Salesforce org and replicate them in another.
* Send a Slack message every time a Google Sheet is updated.
* Check your Tableau data every fifteen minutes, and if the data changed, copy those changes to a different Tableau data source.

You can also combine multiple actions in a single flow, such as replicating Salesforce records and then sending a Slack message to a particular channel based on the record type. Understanding how the basic building blocks of a flow work together makes it easier to confidently build and test flows. Building a flow is a simple matter of adding a trigger and all the actions you want to perform to complete an automated process.

== Building Composer Flows

After you have collected the information as described in xref:ms_composer_checklist.adoc[the preparation checklist], build and test your flow:

. Create and name a flow.
. In the flow, create a trigger and test it.
. In the flow, create each action in order. Test each action before adding the next.

After these steps are complete, you're ready to activate the flow, and then monitor it.

. Click *Add new connection* and then add the username, password, and URL where you usually type in these credentials. Some systems require different types of information, so be sure to check the reference topic for the system you want to connect.

=== Add an Existing Connection

To select an existing connection, open or start a flow, and then choose *Add new connection*.

=== Change a Connection Name

To change the name of an existing connection that isn't in a deployed flow, choose *Manage*.

=== Change a Connection

You can change connections in any trigger or action. For example, you can create a flow using connections to a Salesforce sandbox org, and then after your flow testing is complete, you can change the connection in your trigger and actions to use a production org.

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that connects to a sandbox:

. Choose a new connection and save your changes.


== Create and Test an Action

After you've tested the complete flow, you're ready to activate.

[NOTE]
If you used connections to sandbox orgs while creating the flow, don't forget to change the connections to production orgs and retest before activating.
