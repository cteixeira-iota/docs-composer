= Build a Composer Flow

After you collect the information described in xref:ms_composer_checklist.adoc[the preparation checklist], you can then build, xref:ms_composer_activation.adoc[activate], and xref:ms_composer_monitoring.adoc[monitor] your flows. Building a flow involves creating a new flow or cloning an existing flow; adding and testing a trigger; adding and testing each action to be performed by the flow, in the order that you want each action performed; and finally testing the completed new flow before activating it.

IMPORTANT: xref:ms_composer_test_flow.adoc[Test] each trigger and action as you add it to your flow.

== Create a Flow

You can create a new flow or clone an existing flow.

=== Create a New Flow

To create a new flow:

. From the Composer *Home* page, click *Create New Flow*.
. Click the pencil icon next to *Untitled Flow* and give your flow a name.
+
You can update this name later, if necessary, but if you choose instead to skip this step, the first time that you attempt to save, test, or activate the flow, you are first prompted to supply a flow name.
. Click *Save*.

Now you are ready to create a flow trigger.

=== Clone an Existing Flow

To clone an existing flow:

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, click the name of the flow you want to clone. Composer displays the Flow Details page.
. Click *Clone*.
. Composer copies the existing flow and opens the copy in the Flow Details page. Notice the flow is named *Copy of _original flow name_*.
. Click the pencil icon next to *Copy of _original flow name_* and give your flow a name.
+
You can update this name later, if necessary, but if you choose instead to skip this step, the first time that you attempt to save, test, or activate the flow, you are first prompted to supply a flow name.
. Click *Save*.

== Create a Flow Trigger

After you create or clone a flow, define the trigger: the event or time interval that starts the flow. A trigger step is required to test or activate your flow.

To define a trigger based on an event:

. Open a flow if it is not already open. The *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog is displayed.
+

. Select the system where the triggering event occurs. Your existing connections are displayed.
+
image:images/list-of-connections.png[List of connections, 500]
+
You can choose an existing connection or create a new one:

* Click an existing connection to select it.
* Click *Add new Salesforce Connection* to create a new connection and select it.
+
You can rename or delete connections from this dialog by clicking the gear icon.

. After you choose a connection, the trigger step displays:
+
image:images/trigger-definition.png[Trigger step, 600]
+
* Rename *Untitled Step* with a trigger name of your choice.
* Choose an event that starts the flow. Supply additional information as requested.
* Click *Save*.

[[change-a-connection]]
== Change a Connection

You can change connections in a trigger or action. For example, you can create a flow using connections to a Salesforce sandbox org, and then after your flow testing is complete, you can change the connection in your trigger and actions to use a production org.

You can only change to a connection accessing the same system type. You can't change a Workday connection to a Google Sheets connection, for example.

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that connects to a sandbox:
+
image::images/change-connection.png[Change the connection control, 400]

. Choose a new connection and click *Save*.

== Schedule a Flow

If you don't choose a connection, you can schedule a flow to start at regular intervals.

To create a flow control:

. In a new flow, from the *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog, look in the Flow Control section and click *Scheduler*.
+
image:images/connection-example.png[What Should Start This Flow dialog, 500]
. Choose one of the time intervals, from 15 minutes to 30 days.
+
image::images/connection-scheduler.png[New trigger with time interval, 500]
. Click *Save*.

After creating the trigger, add one or more actions to the flow. To apply logic to an action, prepend it with an <<create-an-if-else-block,If/Else block>> or <<create-and-test-a-for-each-loop,For Each>> loop.

== Create an Action

To create an action:

. After the trigger in your flow, click the large plus sign to open the *Add Action* dialog.
. Click or create a connection for the action.
+
For example, if your trigger is "new records created in Salesforce," and you want your action to be "copy new record to a Google Sheet," then you would choose or create a Google Sheet connection.
. Select an action, and any other values displayed. What you have to specify for an action depends on system type you are connected to for the action.
. Click *Save*.

== Create a Flow Control

If you need to perform some logic before an action, select a flow control first:

. After the trigger in your flow, click the large plus sign to open the *Add Action* dialog.
. Click either *If/Else Block* or *For Each*. An If/Else block is good when you need to do different actions depending on one or more conditions. A For Each loop is good for processing a set of records.
. Complete the flow control, which usually includes adding an action.
. Click *Save*.

[[create-an-if-else-block]]
=== Create an If/Else Block

You can create an If/Else block to set conditions and execute actions only when specific criteria are met. This enables you to create flows that cover more than one linear path, or branch, without the need to create separate projects or flows.

==== Creating Branches

Branches are logic-based steps that run vertically in a flow.  You can add multiple steps inside each branch.

==== Building Conditions

When adding decision steps:

* The *Field* value list is populated ba sed on the paramters selcted in the After the *Field* value is selected, all the compatible options appear in the *Operator* list. 


The following operators are supported when building conditions in an If/Else block:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Function | Supported Data Type | Value Required? | Notes
|Equals/Does not equal | All | Yes |The value in this field is case sensitive for strings.
|Contains/Does not contain | Array, String | Yes |
|Greater than/ Less than |  Date, Number | Yes | In the *Date* field, *Greater than* is equal to a later date and *Less than* is equal to an earlier date.
|Greater than or equal/Less than or equal | Date, Number | In the *Date* field, *Greater than or equal* is equal to a later date and *Less than or equal* is equal to an earlier date. |
|Is empty/Is not empty |Array, String, Object | No |
|Starts with/Ends with | String | Yes | The value in this field must be a string.
|Is true/Is False | Boolean | No |
| Is present/Is not present | All | No | If the value in this field is null or if there is no value selected, then the value in this field is set to *Not present* by default.
|===

To create an If/Else block:

. Click the plus sign after the trigger or the last action in your flow.
. Click *Add Action*.
. Click *If/Else Block* to define the first branch.
. Enter the requested criteria.
. Click the plus sign to add an action. Every condition must have an action, also called a step.
. Click *Add If* and repeat the previous steps for every If/Else branch you create.
. Click *Add Else* and repeat the previous steps for the final branch--the action to take if all other branches fail.
. After you add all the branches, click *Save*.

For the purposes of comparing flows, if you initiate a date comparison when building a flow and there is no value in one of the date fields, the missing value is updated to `0001-01-01` by default.

[[create-and-test-a-for-each-loop]]
=== Create a For Each Loop

To create a For Each Loop:

. Click the plus sign after the trigger or the last action in your flow.
. Click *Add Action*.
. Click *For Each*.
. Choose a data pill from the *Input list*. You must have a trigger or action that returns a set of records or there won't be anything to choose here.
. Click the plus sign to add an action.
. After you complete the action, click *Save*.

You can add logic and actions in different patterns, depending on what your flow needs to do.
