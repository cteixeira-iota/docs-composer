= Build Composer Flows

After you have collected the information as described in the Composer Checklist, build and test your flow:

. Create a trigger and test it.
. Create each action in order. Test each action before adding another.

After these steps are complete, you're ready to activate the flow, and then monitor it.

After you've tested the complete flow, you're ready to activate.

If you used connections to sandbox orgs while creating the flow, don't forget to change the connections to production orgs and retest before activating.
