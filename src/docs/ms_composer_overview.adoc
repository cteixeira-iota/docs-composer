= MuleSoft Composer Overview


When you connect data between apps and services, you build a real-time, integrated view of your customers and your business.
MuleSoft Composer (Composer) helps you build those connections with clicks instead of code from within your Salesforce org.

MuleSoft Composer is available from within your Salesforce org, and you can connect it to several data sources, including:

* Another Salesforce org
* A Tableau server
* A Google sheet
* A NetSuite account
* A Workday account

_We need a better image, but are these the concepts we should be showing first?_

To create a functioning, real-time integration, you simply define a connection, define the actions you want to
be done and under what circumstances you want them done. Then you test, and when satisified that the flow is
behaving as you expect, click a button to activate the integration.

You define all the steps and definitions related to an integration in a flow:

* One or more connections, which can be used by any flow, once defined
* A trigger--the condition or event that triggers your flow to start working on data
* The data to be retrieved
* The conditions you apply to each piece of data to determine whether or not to take action
* The action you wish to take if the conditions are satisfied

You can do something as simple as "copy the name field from each new User record to my ???" or as complicated
as ???

== How It Works

MuleSoft Composer provides the point-and-click tools you need to flow data between different systems.

Before you create a flow, you should know:

* The source of data you want to extract. You'll use this information when you define a connection.
* The circumstances under which you want to extract the data. For example, you might want to do soemthing every time a Salesforce Profile record is created or updated, or you might want to export every new row in your Tableau table. You'll use this information to create a trigger statement such as "for every new record."
* The specific data to extract, and its structure, and what you want to do with the data. what you do with the data you extract--perhaps transforming it, or moving it to a new data store, or checking the data to trigger action elsewhere.

After you create a flow, you can test and activate it:

. Test your flow to make sure it does what you expect it to do. Tests are performed on a single actual record.
. Activate your flow--now it will run every time the trigger condition is met. You may have chosen to trigger the flow at specified time intervals, or when a certain action is performed.

== Next Steps

Let's look at an example. Saura, a Salesforce admin, needs to quickly connect two different data sources to improve efficiency for her sales team.
