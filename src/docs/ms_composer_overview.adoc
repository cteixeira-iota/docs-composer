= MuleSoft Composer Overview


When you connect data between apps and services, you build a real-time, integrated view of your customers and your business.
MuleSoft Composer (Composer) helps you build those connections with clicks instead of code from within your Salesforce org.

Composer is available in your Salesforce org. You can connect it to several data sources, including:

* Another Salesforce org
* A Tableau server
* A Google sheet
* A NetSuite account
* A Workday account

Most data integrations involve selecting data from a data source and mapping it to a data target, and transferring the data.
Integrations can be triggered whenever an action occurs or at intervals of time that you specify.

For example, a repair person needs to know where the next job is with one click on their portable device,
even though repair requests and full customer data are stored in two different Salesforce orgs.

With one flow set up in MuleSoft Composer, the repair person has the address available without looking up anything, and the customer is
automatically contacted with an arrival time.

To create a functioning, real-time integration in Composer:

. Define how you will connect to each data source with a specific username and password. Once defined, this connection can be used as often as needed.
The credentials are never exposed.
. Define the actions you want to be done and under which circumstances you want them done by choosing object types, fields, and logic like "every email address that contains ```gmail```."
. Test your definitions until you are satisified that the integration is
behaving as you expect.
. Click a button to activate the integration.
. Monitor the behavior of your integration.

== How It Works

MuleSoft Composer provides the point-and-click tools you need to flow data between different systems.

Before you create a flow, you should know:

* The source of data you want to extract. You'll use this information when you define a connection.
* The circumstances under which you want to extract the data. For example, you might want to do something every time a Salesforce Profile record is created or updated, or you might want to export every new row in your Tableau table. You'll use this information to create a trigger statement such as "for every new record."
* The specific data to extract, and its structure, and what you want to do with the data. what you do with the data you extract--perhaps transforming it, or moving it to a new data store, or checking the data to trigger action elsewhere.
* What you want to do with the data: map it to data in another data store (data target), transform it, or use it to trigger some other action.
If you can, use a sandbox for your data target until all testing is complete.
After you create a flow, you can test, activate, and monitor it:

. Test your flow to make sure it does what you expect it to do. Tests are performed on a single actual record.
. Activate your flow--now it will run every time the trigger condition is met. You may have chosen to trigger the flow at specified time intervals, or when a certain action is performed.
. Monitor the performance of your flow.
. Optionally, if you created the flow in a sandbox org, move it to production.

== Next Steps

Let's look at an example. Saura, a Salesforce admin, needs to quickly connect two different data sources to improve efficiency for her sales team.
